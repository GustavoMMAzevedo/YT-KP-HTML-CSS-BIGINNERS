       <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
       <p><strong><em><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/12898/lorem-ipsum#:~:text=Originally%20from%20Latin%2C%20Lorem%20ipsum,generic%20text%20in%20a%20file." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lorem Ipsum</a></em></strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
       <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
       when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>
       <p>It has <i>survived</i> not only <b>five centuries</b>, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
       It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
       and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
